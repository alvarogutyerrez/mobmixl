### How to reproduce the results form Guti√©rrez-Vargas, Vandebroek & Meulders (2023)

The replication file for the MOB-MIXL model are called:

-   `MobMixlogit_Triangular.R`
-   `MobMixlogit_Normal.R`

Since the number of draws is rather large it will take up to a couple of days to complete. However, you can also download the resulting `.rds` files from Google Drive using the R script named:

-   `_download_partykit_rds_files.R`

Said file uses the `googledrive` library (from `tidyverse`) to download the files.

Finally, to replicate the final tables and figures from the article you can use the R script named:

-   `MobMixlogit_table_generator.R`

This file will recreate the LaTeX code of the Tables and all the Figures related to the decision trees and you will also see this results on screen:
